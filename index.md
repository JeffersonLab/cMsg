# **cMsg Software Package**

----------------------------

The cMsg package is designed to provide client programs with a uniform interface to an underlying
messaging system via an API powerful enough to encompass asynchronous publish/subscribe and
synchronous peer-to-peer messaging. The advantage of using the cMsg API is that client programs
need not change if the underlying messaging system is modified or replaced.

But cMsg provides much more than a simple API. The package includes a number of built-in messaging
systems, including a complete, stand-alone, asynchronous publish/subscribe and synchronous
peer-to-peer messaging system, as well as a persistent network queuing system.
Although cMsg is highly customizable and extendable, most users will simply use one of the built-in
messaging systems. In addition, a number of useful utilities and examples are provided.
