cMsg Software Package

This is a short guide to the installation and running of cMsg (pronounced see message).
cMsg can be downloaded from the Jefferson Lab ftp site by going to
ftp://ftp.jlab.org/pub/coda/cMsg/0.9beta  and grabbing a number of files.
For everything, get cMsg-0.9.tar.gz. For the java classes, grab the cMsg-0.9.jar
file. And, of course, this file (README) and the copyright (NOTICE) are also available.


FULL INSTALLATION PREREQUISITES:

* Java version 1.5 must be installed and in the user's path.
    Test this by typing "java -version". If it returns a statement
    saying it is java 1.5 you are in business. Otherwise it can be
    downloaded from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp .
* To create the java programmer's guide documentation, "javadoc"
    must also be in the user's path.
* doxygen version 1.3.9 or later must be installed and in the user's path
    for the C and C++ programmer's guide documentation to be generated.
    It can be downloaded from http://www.doxygen.org .
* Operating system must be Linux or Solaris.


FULL INSTALLATION:

* download cMsg-0.9.tar.gz
* do unix command:  tar xfz cMsg-0.9.tar.gz
* cd into cMsg directory
* type "make"


PLATFORMS:

This software is designed to be made on Solaris and Linux.
To date it has run on Solaris8/9 and on Redhat EL3 (2.4 kernel).
C clients can also be made for VxWorks on the PPC platform.
To make for VxWorks, all of the Makefile.vxworks files must be
modified to point to the proper cross compiler, include file directory, etc.
Set the ARCH environmental variable to VXWORKSPPC,
then type "make" from the top level directory.


DOCUMENTATION:

The developer's and user's guides can be found in the "doc" directory.
When typing "make", the last thing the Makefile does is create the
progammer's guide documentation. First the java documentation is created
by running "javadoc". Next the documentation for C and C++ are generated
by doxygen. If this fails because doxygen does not exist, the installation
should still be complete with the only exception being the programmer's guide
documentation.


RUNNING THE CMSG SERVER:

Simply type the command,

    java -cp <installdir>/cMsg/jar/cMsg-0.9.jar org/jlab/coda/cMsg/cMsgDomain/server/cMsgNameServer
    
where <installdir> is where the cMsg directory is located.
If you want lots of informational output from the server, use this form,

    java -cp <install dir>/cMsg/jar/cMsg-0.9.jar -Ddebug=info org/jlab/coda/cMsg/cMsgDomain/server/cMsgNameServer


RUNNING A JAVA MESSAGE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER

To run the producer & consumer type,

    java -cp <install dir>/cMsg/jar/cMsg-0.9.jar org/jlab/coda/cMsg/apps/cMsgProducer -debug -u cMsg://<serverhost>:3456/cMsg/test
and 
    java -cp <install dir>/cMsg/jar/cMsg-0.9.jar org/jlab/coda/cMsg/apps/cMsgConsumer -debug -u cMsg://<serverhost>:3456/cMsg/test

respectively, where <installdir> is where the cMsg directory is located,
<serverhost> is the name of the computer running the server, and the
"-debug" flag prints the rate of messages being produced or consumed.


RUNNING A C MESSAGE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER

To run the producer & consumer type,

    <installdir>/bin/Linux/producer
and
    <installdir>/bin/Linux/consumer
    
where <installdir> is where the cMsg directory is located.
If running on Solaris, substitute "SunOS" for "Linux".
