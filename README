cMsg Software Package

You must install Java version 1.5 or higher if you plan to compile
the cMsg code and run it. If you're using the jar file from the CODA
website, version 1.6 or higher is necessary since it was compiled with
version 1.6.0_24.

If you only plan to run C/C++ clients (i.e. if
you will use someone else's cMsg server) you can skip the Java
installation. If you only plan to use Java domains and clients
you can skip the C/C++ installation.


1) Getting & Installing cMsg

The cMsg package, including documentation, can be found on the
JLab Data Acquisition Group CODA wiki at http://coda.jlab.org.
For Java users, a jar file is available for download and is
usually all that is needed.

To install all of cMsg, download the cMsg-3.x.tar.gz
file (or whatever version happens to be current) and untar it.
This will give you a full cMsg distribution with the top level
directory being cMsg-3.x. The documentation, is available on the
above-mentioned web site but also exists in the doc subdirectory
of the full distribution.

Note that for C/C++, only Linux, Solaris, and Darwin (Mac OSX)
operating systems are supported. The libraries and executables
are placed into the $CODA/<arch>/lib and bin subdirectories
(eg. ...Linux-x86_64/lib).  Be sure to change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environmental variable to include the correct lib directory.


2) C/C++ code

Compiling using SCons

From the SCons website:
"SCons is an Open Source software
construction tool -- that is, a next-generation build tool.
Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for
the classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar
to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short,
SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build software."

SCons is written in python, thus to use this build system with cMsg,
both python and SCons packages need previous installation. If your
system does not have one or the other, go to the http://www.python.org/
and http://www.scons.org/ websites for downloading.

The SCons files needed for compiling are already included as part of
the cMsg distribution. To compile, the user needs merely to run "scons"
in the top level cMsg directory. To compile and install libraries and
header files, first define the CODA environmental variable containing
the directory in which to install things and then run "scons install".

The following is a table of SCons compilation options:

scons -h              print out help
scons -c              remove all generated files

scons install         make C and C++ library code;
                      place libraries in architecture-specific lib
                      directory and headers in an include directory

scons examples        make C and C++ executable example code;
                      place executables in architecture-specific bin directory

scons -c install      uninstall libs & headers
scons -c examples     uninstall executable examples

scons tar             create a tar file (cMsg-3.x.tgz) of the cMsg top level
                      directory and put in ./tar directory

scons doc             generate html documentation from javadoc and doxygen
                      comments in the source code and put in ./doc directory

scons --dbg           compile with debug flag
scons --32bits        compile 32bit libraries & executables on 64bit system
scons --vx5.5         cross compile for vxworks version 5.5
scons --vx6.0         cross compile for vxworks version 6.0

scons --prefix=<dir>  use base directory <dir> when doing install.
                      Defaults to CODA environmental variable.
                      Libs go in <dir>/<arch>/lib, headers in <dir>/<arch>/include
                      and executables in <dir>/<arch>/bin

scons --incdir=<dir>  copy header files to directory <dir> when doing install
                      (takes precedence over --prefix or default location)

scons --libdir=<dir>  copy library files to directory <dir> when doing install
                      (takes precedence over --prefix or default location)


You can see these options by running "scons -h"


Note that currently only Linux, Solaris, and Darwin (Mac OSX)
operating systems are fully supported. The libraries and executables
are placed into the $CODA/<arch>/lib and bin subdirectories
(eg. ...Linux-x86_64/lib).  Be sure to change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environmental variable to include the correct lib directory.

All libraries and a limited set of executables are also supported for
vxworks versions 5.5 and 6.0 .


3) JAVA

One can download the cMsg-3.x.jar file from the CODA website or it can
be generated from the general cMsg distribution.  In either case,
put the jar file into your classpath and run your java application.

If you're using the jar file from the CODA website, java version 1.6 or
higher is necessary since it was compiled with version 1.6.0_24. If
generating it, use java version 1.5 or higher to compile.

If you wish to recompile the java part of cMsg, ant must be installed
on your system (http://ant.apache.org). First extract the package files
from the general cMsg tar file:
  
# download cMsg-3.x.tar.gz into <top>
$ cd <top>
$ tar -fxz cMsg-3.x.tar.gz 
$ cd cMsg-3.x
$ ant

To get a list of options with ant, type "ant help":

 ant  help       - print out usage
 ant  env        - print out build file variables' values
 ant  compile    - compile java files
 ant  clean      - remove class files
 ant  cleanall   - remove all generated files
 ant  jar        - compile and create cmsg jar file
 ant  install    - create cmsg jar file and install all jars into 'prefix'
 ant               if given on command line by -Dprefix=dir',
 ant               else install into CODA if defined
 ant               (ET jar file is not installed)
 ant  uninstall  - remove all jar files previously installed into 'prefix'
 ant               if given on command line by -Dprefix=dir',
 ant               else installed into CODA if defined
 ant               (ET jar file is not removed)
 ant  all        - clean, compile and create cmsg jar file
 ant  javadoc    - create javadoc documentation
 ant  developdoc - create javadoc documentation for developer
 ant  prepare    - create necessary directories


To generate a new cmsg jar file, type "ant jar" which will
create the file and place it in <top>/build/lib .

Included in the <top>/java/jars subdirectory are all auxiliary jar files used
by the built-in domains and subdomains. Thus to use the Channel Access
or the SmartSockets (sub)domains the user must include the necessary
jar files in the classpath. These (all except the ET jar file) are installed
when executing "ant install". Check the individual package web sites
for more information.


4) Documentation

All documentation is available from http://coda.jlab.org.

However, if using the downloaded distribution, some of the documentation
needs to be generated and some already exists. For existing docs look in
doc/users_guide and doc/developers_guide for pdf and Microsoft Word
format documents.

Some of the documentation is in the source code itself and must be generated
and placed into its own directory.
The java code is documented with, of course, javadoc and the C/C++ code is
documented with doxygen comments (identical to javadoc comments).

To generate all the these docs, type
    "scons doc"
from the top level directory.

The javadoc is placed in the doc/javadoc directory.
The doxygen docs for C code are placed in the doc/doxygen/C/html directory,
and the doxygen docs for C++ code are placed in the doc/doxygen/CC/html directory.
To view the html documentation, just point your browser to the index.html
file in each of those directories.

Alternatively, just the java documentation can be generated by typing
    "ant javadoc"
for user-level documentation, or
    "ant developdoc"
for developer-level documentation.

This generated documentation takes up a great deal of disk space and can be
removed by deleting the doc/javadoc and doc/doxygen directories.
