Changes from the previous version:

Version 3.5
    - Bug fixes:
        -- problem with payload of double type
        -- put rc domain multicast packets over all network interfaces

    - add user xml fragment to monitoring data

    - update jar files for EPICS channel access and ET

    - add scons option to remove documentation

    - add ant options to:
        -- remove documentation
        -- uninstall jar files

    - both "scons install" and "ant install" places files into $CODA/...
      where CODA is an environmental variable
  
    - "scons install" builds all executable files. FIles in src/test and src/examples
      are placed in bin/test, and bin/examples.


Version 3.5.1
    - add emu domain in Java for communication between Rocs and EBs
    - add syncSend to rc server domain to act as a ping of client

Version 3.6
    - add emu domain in C language for communication between Rocs and EBs
    - fix flags for Mac OSX compilation 9/22/4104

Version 4.0
    - fix bug in java rc client listening thread that does not properly
              handle multiple attempts to connect.
    - fix bug in java rc client connect that leaves thread running even when it fails.
    - fix bug in C rc client that does not reconnect back to rc server.
    - fix bug in C, cmsg domain client, freeing memory already freed
    - fix bug in rc server listening thread which unregisters the udp socket from select

    - cMsg, rc, and emu domains implement optional use of a preferred subnet

    - change java API getString() method. It is now getInfo() and takes a String arg.

    - add getServerHost and getServerPort to API & implement in rc, cMsg, and emu domains

	- change the cMsg domain communication protocol allowing the handling
      of multiple server IP addresses

	- change the C rc client so that the cMsgMonitor() call is now implemented.
	  It returns a msg in which cMsgGetSenderHost will return the rc multicast server's host.

	- change the rc multicast domain communication protocol so that the rc client monitor()
	  call in both C and Java returns a cMsg message with a String array payload item
	  named "IpAddresses" which contains all the server's dot-decimal IP addresses.

    - internal change: don't poll channels, transports, and modules for errors to determine
      state. Have them report and error when it occurs. Eliminate unnecessary locks when
      finding state and reporting errors/stats.
      Have reset shut down ability for chan, trans, mods to change state.

    - if a client uses a password, but the cMsg server has none, cMsg now rejects the connection.
      In previous versions it allowed the connection. This change was made so that
      a cMsg server's password can act as a name. Clients can now multicast while specifying
      that password and will get a response from that server only (if it is unique).
